## Description
Social Network API is a backend for a social media application. Routes are created through Express.js, data is stored in a MongoDB Database along with the help of the ODM Mongoose. With this API, users can create Users, Friends (referencing the User model), Thoughts, and Reactions to those Thoughts.
